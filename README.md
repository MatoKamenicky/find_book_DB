5. **Deletions:**
   - Exercise caution when deleting records, as it may impact related data. Use the DELETE CASCADE feature judiciously.

6. **Backups:**
   - Regularly backup the database to prevent data loss in case of accidental deletions or system failures.

7. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Keep the documentation updated as the database evolves, ensuring that it accurately reflects the structure and relationships.
